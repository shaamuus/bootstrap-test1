## My Bootstrap Test
- This was my first attempt at developing a webpage using bootstrap 4
- To be honest, I felt like I was cheating by writing hardly any CSS, but I guess thats the luxury of the bootstrap library
- I'm feeling more confident with my undestanding of Bootstrap 4 and how to implement it and its benefits.
